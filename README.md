For this project, I analyzed data in Google Colab from the last 20 years of California's energy reports to address the following questions in the wake of the rolling blackouts in the state summer of 2022:

- What does this mean for the future of Californiaâ€™s energy grid?
- As California attempts to phase out fossil fuels, how will it provide electricity to all its
citizens?

I processed the data and used various dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis and multi-dimensional scaling. I plotted the data in several visualizations--line graph, stacked bar charts, scatter plot matrix--and interpreted the results. I created several data mining models including simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, LASSO regression, k-NN regression, and k-NN classification. I compared the performance evaluation metrics of each model to find the best model.
